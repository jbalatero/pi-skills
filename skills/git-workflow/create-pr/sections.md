# Pull Request Sections

Detailed guidance for optional PR body sections.

## Issue

Use for bug fixes, which should include a related issue.

- Provide root cause analysis
- Link existing issues with `Closes #123` or `Fixes #456`

## Changes

Organize by concept, not by file. Each bullet should describe a single conceptual shift, even when it spans multiple files. The reviewer reads this to understand *what's different and why*, not to get a tour of modified files.

- Lead with the conceptual change, not the file location
- Omit cleanup that follows naturally from the main change (e.g. removing dead imports). The diff shows this
- Never structure bullets as `**path**: description`
- Reference code identifiers only when they add information beyond what the diff shows. Use the shortest unambiguous name (module, filename, or component, not full paths)
- When referring to a set of things changed, write naturally: enumerate short lists inline (e.g. "hook command variants (command, model, prompt)"), use "all" or "each" for large sets. Never pair a count with the enumeration ("all three X (a, b, c)"). Either enumerate or summarize, not both

## Testing

Only include if tests were added/modified or manual testing was performed. Omit entirely if no testing discussion is relevant.

**NEVER mention test counts** - phrases like "Added N tests" or "13 unit tests" provide no value. The number of tests doesn't indicate coverage quality, and readers can count tests themselves if they care.

Focus on **what** is covered and **why** it matters:

**Good examples:**
- "Tests cover error handling for malformed JSON responses"
- "Added integration tests for the full request/response cycle"
- "Extended auth tests to cover the new OAuth flow"
- "Verified edge cases: empty input, null values, and Unicode handling"

**Coverage gaps**: Note anything that merited testing but was difficult to automate:
- "Rate limiting behavior requires manual verification against live API"
- "Visual layout changes verified in browser but not covered by snapshot tests"

**Manual verification**: Include any testing done outside of automated tests—running commands, checking output, verifying behavior in a browser or tool. This counts whether performed by the user or by the agent during the session.

**Patterns to avoid:**
- "Added N tests" or "N unit tests" (counts are noise)
- "All tests passed" (CI shows this)
- "Tests work correctly" (too vague)
- Listing test file names without explaining coverage

## References

Only include if there are relevant links or related issues.

- Bulleted list of links, related issues, code reviews
- Use `Closes #<issue>` if the change closes an issue
