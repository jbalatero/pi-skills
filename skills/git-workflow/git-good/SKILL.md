# git-good

**Git history belongs to the user. Never rewrite, delete, or force-push without explicit approval.**

When in doubt, create a new commit. New commits are always reversible.

**Never argue that correctness doesn't matter because of workflow.** Squash-merge, rebase, CI - none of these excuse sloppy history. If you know the right thing to do, do it. Don't push the decision to the user.

## Gate

Before running any git command, check this table. If it matches a row, follow the instruction. If no match, proceed.

| If you're about to...                | Do this instead                                          |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `git commit --amend`                 | `git commit --fixup=<sha>`                               |
| `git add .` or `git add -A`          | `git add <specific-files>`                               |
| `git push --force`                   | Ask user, then `git push --force-with-lease`             |
| `git reset --hard`                   | Prefer `git reset --soft`, ask user before either        |
| `git checkout --theirs` / `--ours`   | Edit conflict markers manually                           |
| `git checkout -- <file>`             | Prefer `git restore`; both discard uncommitted changes   |
| `git rebase`                         | Create safety branch first, ask user                     |
| `git rebase --skip`                  | Ask user - this drops a commit's changes entirely        |
| `git branch -D`                      | Ask user                                                 |
| `git clean -f`                       | Ask user                                                 |
| `git stash drop` / `git stash clear` | Ask user - permanently discards stashed work             |
| Amend at a rebase `edit` stop        | `git commit --fixup=<sha>`, then `git rebase --continue` |
| Create a fixup then autosquash it    | Stop. Let the user review the fixup commits first        |
| `git rebase -i --autosquash`         | Audit fixup targets first (see Autosquash checklist)     |
| HEAD is detached (no branch)         | Create a branch before committing: `git switch -c <name>`|
| Rebase/merge already in progress     | Resolve or abort before doing anything else              |

**First git operation in a session?** Run `git config --get merge.conflictstyle`. If not `diff3`, warn the user: set `git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3` for three-way conflict markers.

## Commits

### fixup, not amend

Never `git commit --amend`. Always `git commit --fixup=<sha>`.

Amend rewrites in-place - the user can't review what changed. Fixup creates a separate commit the user can inspect before squashing with `git rebase -i --autosquash`.

This rule applies in every context:

- **Regular commits:** `--fixup=<sha>`, not `--amend`
- **Review feedback:** fixes go in a `--fixup` commit against the reviewed SHA
- **Rebase edit stops:** git says "You can amend the commit now" - ignore it. Stage changes, `git commit --fixup=<sha>`, `git rebase --continue`
- **Never fixup + autosquash in sequence.** That's amend with extra steps. Let the user review first.

**Target the commit that introduced the code you're fixing.** Use `git log -S` or `git blame` to find it. Don't target the most recent commit out of convenience. Before autosquashing, audit fixup targets (see Autosquash checklist).

The only exception: the user explicitly says "amend."

### Stage specific files

Never `git add .` or `git add -A`. Stage by path. Review with `git diff --staged` before committing.

### Verify your branch

Before committing, check `git branch --show-current`. If it returns empty, you're in detached HEAD - create a branch with `git switch -c <name>`. If it returns `main` or another protected branch, ask the user whether you should be working on a feature branch instead.

### Follow conventions

Check `git log --oneline -10` and match the user's commit message style. Check `git branch --list` and match their branch naming. Do not impose any scheme.

## Conflicts

Applies during rebases, merges, and cherry-picks.

### Read all three sides

With diff3, conflict markers have three sections:

```
<<<<<<< ours
||||||| base (common ancestor)
=======
>>>>>>> theirs
```

Before editing, understand: what did ours change vs base? What did theirs change vs base? Can both coexist, or do they conflict semantically?

### Edit surgically

- Modify only lines inside the conflict region
- Remove ALL conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `|||||||`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
- Never replace an entire file with one side
- Verify with `git diff -- <file>` - if one side is entirely deleted, you picked a side instead of merging

### When to stop

If you can't confidently combine both sides, describe the conflict to the user and ask. Never guess on semantic conflicts.

## Destructive Ops

These commands destroy work or rewrite history. Never run without explicit user approval:

| Command                                   | Risk                                 |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `git push --force` / `--force-with-lease` | Rewrites remote history              |
| `git reset --hard`                        | Discards uncommitted work            |
| `git checkout .` / `git restore .`        | Discards all unstaged changes        |
| `git checkout -- <file>`                  | Discards uncommitted changes to file |
| `git clean -f` / `-fd`                    | Deletes untracked files permanently  |
| `git branch -D`                           | Force-deletes a branch               |
| `git stash drop` / `git stash clear`      | Permanently discards stashed work    |
| `git rebase` / `git rebase -i`            | Rewrites commit history              |
| `git rebase --skip`                       | Drops a commit's changes entirely    |
| `git filter-branch` / `git filter-repo`   | Rewrites entire repository history   |

When approved, follow these protocols:

- **Force push:** `--force-with-lease`, never `--force`
- **Reset:** prefer `--soft` over `--hard`
- **Rebase:** create `temp/pre-rebase-<branch>` first, verify clean working tree
- **After rebase:** `git diff --stat temp/pre-rebase-<branch>` to verify, then build and test

---

## Reference

Detailed procedures for complex operations. The rules above take precedence.

### Rebase checklist

**Pre-flight:**

1. Verify branch: `git branch --show-current`
2. Verify clean: `git status --porcelain` (must be empty)
3. Safety branch: `git branch temp/pre-rebase-<branch>`
4. Note SHA: `git rev-parse --short HEAD`

**Per-commit conflicts:** Follow the Conflicts section above. Additionally:

- If rerere is enabled: `git rerere diff` to inspect what rerere auto-applied
- If cached resolution looks wrong: `git rerere forget <file>`

**Post-rebase:**

1. `git diff --stat temp/pre-rebase-<branch>` - unexpected changes mean something went wrong
2. For reorder-only rebases (autosquash): verify tree identity.
   `git rev-parse "temp/pre-rebase-<branch>^{tree}"` must equal `git rev-parse "HEAD^{tree}"`.
   Same content, different history. If they differ, the rebase changed file content - something leaked.
3. Build and test
4. If broken: `git reset --hard temp/pre-rebase-<branch>`
5. Don't delete safety branch until user confirms

### Autosquash checklist

Before running `git rebase -i --autosquash`, audit the fixup commits. During a review session, fixups accumulate and may incorrectly target commits by concept ("this is about feature X") rather than by file ("this file was introduced in commit Y"). Autosquash reorders fixups to follow their target, so a mistargetted fixup tries to modify files that don't exist yet.

#### 1. Audit fixup targets

For each `fixup!` commit, check that every file it modifies exists in the target commit's tree:

```
git show --stat <target-sha>
```

If the fixup modifies files not listed, it's mistargetted.

#### 2. Fix mistargetted fixups

- **Wrong target:** the fixup modifies files that all belong to a different commit. Retarget by creating a new fixup against the correct SHA, cherry-pick the changes, and drop the old fixup.
- **Mixed target:** the fixup modifies files from multiple original commits. Split it: stage files per-target and create separate fixup commits for each.

#### 3. Verify the todo list

Run `git rebase -i --autosquash` and review the generated todo before proceeding. Each fixup should appear directly after the commit that introduced the files it modifies. If a fixup is ordered after a commit that doesn't contain its files, abort and fix the targeting.

#### 4. Run the rebase and verify tree identity

After autosquash completes, the tree hash must match the pre-rebase state (same content, different history):

```
git rev-parse "temp/pre-rebase-<branch>^{tree}"
git rev-parse "HEAD^{tree}"
```

If they differ, something leaked during conflict resolution.

### Conflict resolution map

For complex rebases (10+ commits or expected multiple conflicts), build a map before starting:

1. List commits: `git log --oneline <target>..<branch>`
2. Files per commit: `git show --stat --oneline <sha>`
3. Files changed on target: `git diff --name-only $(git merge-base HEAD <target>) <target>`
4. Intersecting files will likely conflict. Document resolution strategy per file.

### rerere cache

rerere caches conflict resolutions for replay. A bad resolution gets silently re-applied.

- After every conflict resolution: `git rerere diff` (inspect the resolution rerere will record)
- Bad resolution for a specific file: `git rerere forget <path>` (requires active conflicts)
- Nuke the entire cache: `rm -rf .git/rr-cache/*`
- When retrying a failed rebase with suspected bad cache: start the rebase, let rerere auto-apply, then `git rerere diff` on bad auto-resolutions and re-resolve manually

### Recovery

- **reflog:** `git reflog` shows every HEAD position. Find the entry before the mistake, `git reset --hard <sha>`.
- **Safety branch:** `git reset --hard temp/pre-rebase-<branch>`
- **Bad amend:** `git reset --soft HEAD@{1}` (restores original commit, amend changes stay staged)
- Always explain to the user: what went wrong, what you're restoring to, what they should verify.

### Prerequisites

**merge.conflictstyle = diff3** (checked on first git op):

Without diff3, conflict markers only show two sides. The base version is critical for understanding what each side changed. Set with `git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3`.

**rerere.enabled = true** (optional):

Caches conflict resolutions for replay. Useful for stacked-diff workflows. Set with `git config --global rerere.enabled true`. See rerere cache section above.
